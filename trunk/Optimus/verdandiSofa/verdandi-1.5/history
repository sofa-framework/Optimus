Version 1.5 (2013-02-28)
-----------

* Methods

- In 'FourDimensionalVariational', added the possibility to add a term to the
  cost function and to the adjoint state by the use of two model functions:
  'GetAdditionalAdjointTerm()' and 'GetAdditionalCostTerm()'.

  'ApplyTangentLinearOperator' was erroneous when the model was defined with
  both the quadratic term and the linear term.
- The fluxes in the shallow-water model were not properly computed. The errors
  had little consequences only in case the space steps and the height were
  close to 1.
- Verdandi directory "include/" was not given to g++ in
  "bin/methods_requirement".

  operator in 'EnsembleKalmanFilter' and 'FourDimensionalVariational'.

  "forecast_state" and "analysis_state".
- Improved 'UnscentedKalmanFilter' and 'ReducedOrderUnscentedKalmanFilter'
  with more suitable types for several intermediate variables.
- Modified 'HamiltonJacobiBellman' so that it can save the time in addition to
  the time step, and so that the output saver decides to save variables using
  the time, not the time step.
- Removed the deprecated calls to MPI in the form 'MPI::Function', instead of
  'MPI_Function'.
- Added tests to check whether MPI has been initialized/finalized before
  calling 'MPI_Init'/'MPI_Finalize'.

* Models

- Improved the model interface for the uncertain parameters.
- Initial import of 'CheckingModel'.

  descriptions provided in the configuration.

  functions of a model and of an observation manager that are required by a
  specified assimilation method.

  the number of members in the ensemble.

  variable 'Nskip' was different from 1.
- In 'FourDimensionalVariational', the method did not compile when the option
  'VERDANDI_WITH_TRAJECTORY_MANAGER' was deactivated.
- In 'HamiltonJacobiBellman', the model was not initialized when the source
  term was included but not the advection term. 
- In 'UnscentedKalmanFilter', the sigma-point matrix was no longer updated.
- In the model 'ShallowWater', the size of the full state vector was erroneous.
- 'QuadraticModel<T>' was compiling only if 'T' was double.
- In 'HamiltonJacobiBellman', the model methods 'FinalizeStep' and 'Finalize'
  are now called only if the advection term or the source term are included.

* Miscellaneous

- Optimized the general SConstruct file: the link flags for the external
  libraries were set twice.
- Removed all exception specifications in class 'Error' and in its derived
  classes.

  to be applied at time "h".
- 'MessageHandler::RemoveRecipient' did not properly erase elements
  from the recipients map.
- The reduction failed when the number of snapshots was greater than
  the size of the state in 'ReducedMinimaxFilter'.
